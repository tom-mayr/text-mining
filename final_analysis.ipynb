    "This project is a demonstration of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), specifically we analyze a dataset of movie reviews from the popular movie review website Letterboxd. The goal is to find a way to reliably detect a set of aspects that are assumed to be of importance when it comes to forming an opinion about a film and then associate polarities with these aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are well-known aspects in the art of film making that regularly come up in reviews or award shows, we don't try to extract aspects with unsupervised machine learning, but rather try to build a robust vocubalary for each pre-defined aspect that ideally covers synonyms and words related to this concept. Here the goal is to balance this keyword vocubalary so we don't over-generalize while still picking up all relevant mentions of the aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "This vocabulary is then used in conjunction with SpaCy and VADER to extract associated sentiments and analyze sentiment polarities."

    "The code for the approach is only a part of what was tested using WordNet. Specifically, in the testing phase, various variations of the code below were considered, e.g. using all the synsets of an aspect label rather than only the most fitting one, using differenct combinations of semantic concepts, trying to filter words with WordNet's built in similarity measures and more. None of these approaches were particularly effective, therefore only the parts below were included here in the final report for demonstration purposes."

      "Sentence: this is the movie.this is the best crime movie, best mystery movie, best period drama, best noir movie, best comedy, best 70s movie, best original soundtrack, best original screenplay, and best acting. so much has already been said about its greatness so i’m just gonna talk about what it means to me personally. what makes this movie stand out is its message. it holds a greater, more powerful message than any other classic movie, the obvious one being that power is evil and the police are corrupt, but the more powerful message to me is: people often don’t understand or underestimate the trauma and depth a woman has under the surface. evelyn is painted as an evil, mysterious “femme fatale” who is hiding her infidelity and demise of her husband. what we don’t know until the end is that it was her own father who, not only killed her husband, but raped her when she was a child. every time her father is brought up she gets visibly uncomfortable. when jj asks her about katherine in the car, faye dunaway gives the most outstanding and painful performance i’ve ever seen. she opens her mouth, like she wants to say it but her body physically can’t. trauma is paralyzing. she asks jj to stay with her, in some last attempt for comfort after being left with an open wound. jj doesn’t understand, saying “i’m tired mrs mulwray,” leaving evelyn alone to finish her hysterics in her car. jj represents blissful ignorance and maybe a little bit of savior complex. he fucks up big time. he thinks he knows everything, he calls the police on evelyn knowing full well how fucked up they are, having experienced firsthand the consequences of its injustices. he went alone and unarmed to meet with noah cross personally just so he could tell him that he knows. then he literally brought the police straight to evelyn. he made a lot of smart decisions in the movie, but even the closest one to the truth can’t even begin to imagine the bigger problem underneath the surface.a slightly better review\n",
