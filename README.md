# text-mining

A project in the Text Mining course at the Master Degree in Data Science for Economics.

The project works on an aspect-based sentiment analysis problem trying to analyse movie reviews for aspect sentiments. The project is a variation of project proposal 2 from https://github.com/afflint/textsent/blob/master/2023-24/projects/projects.md. Instead of using board game reviews we analyse movie reviews. Although the domain of the project is different, the goals remain essentially the same.
